## About Me
ðŸŽ“ I'm a 21-year-old computer science student majoring in cybersecurity at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My interest for this career arose through video games when I was a child, and ever since then I have been passionate about securing systems and building new projects. I enjoy turning complex issues into simple, user-friendly solutions, and I also enjoy learning something new that constantly challenges me, allowing me to grow.

## Projects
ðŸŽ®<span style="font-size:30px;">**Game Bidding Website**</span><br>
I developed a fully functional website where users can create an account and log in. The site allows users to bid on games, with sellers having the option to accept or reject offers. Once an offer is accepted, the game is sold to the user who placed the bid. Buyers can search for games using a search bar, and sellers can edit game listings, providing a seamless experience for both buyers and sellers.

## Goals and Objectives
- ðŸ”§ **Short-Term Goals**: Enhance my skills in web development and cybersecurity by working on more complex projects and gaining practical experience.<br>
- ðŸš€ **Long-Term Objectives**: Build a career in cybersecurity, focusing on securing large-scale systems and networks while continuously learning and adapting to new challenges in the field.
